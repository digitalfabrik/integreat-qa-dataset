## Answer: Die Klage wird abgewiesen. ## Sentence numbers: 7

The sentence "7 Bestätigt es hingegen den ablehnenden Bescheid, wird die Klage abgewiesen." indicates that if the court confirms the negative decision, the lawsuit will be rejected.assistant

That's correct! The sentence "7 Bestätigt es hingegen den ablehnenden Bescheid, wird die Klage abgewiesen." explicitly states that if the court confirms the negative decision, the lawsuit will be rejected, which is the answer to the question "Was passiert, wenn das Gericht die Klage gegen eine asylbewerberentscheidung abweist?" (What happens if the court rejects a lawsuit against an asylum decision?).assistant
