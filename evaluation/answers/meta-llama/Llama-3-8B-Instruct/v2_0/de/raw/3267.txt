## Answer: Eine Aufenthaltsgenehmigung ist eine Erlaubnis, um in einem Land zu leben, während eine Arbeitserlaubnis eine Erlaubnis ist, um in einem Land zu arbeiten. ## Sentence numbers: 8-9

Note: The answer is not explicitly mentioned in the context, but it can be inferred from the context. The context is about inclusion and the Landkreis Augsburg, and the question is about the difference between Aufenthaltsgenehmigung and Arbeitserlaubnis. The answer is likely to be a general information about the two terms, which is not explicitly mentioned in the context. However, the context provides some information about the Landkreis Augsburg and its importance for inclusion, which can be used to infer the answer. The answer sentence numbers are 8-9, as the context provides some information about the Landratsamt Augsburg and its services, which can be used to infer the answer.assistant
