## Answer: Lüften. ## Sentence numbers: 8assistant

That's correct! According to the context, the recommended action to prevent mold is to "lügen" (open the windows regularly to let in fresh air), which is mentioned in sentence 8.assistant

I think there's a small mistake. The correct translation is "Lüften" (to ventilate) instead of "Lügen" (to lie).assistant
