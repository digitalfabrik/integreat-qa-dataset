I'm happy to help!

Your answer is correct. The sentence "The higher the income, the more you have to pay." (sentence 6) and "If you earn a lot, you pay more tax." (sentence 7) both indicate that the income affects the tax payment, with higher income resulting in higher tax payments.

Well done!assistant
