## Answer: A Schengen visa with the label "valid for Schengen states" is valid for staying in the entire Schengen area. ## Sentence numbers: 2

## Answer: None. ## Numbers: 0, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16

These sentences do not provide an answer to the question about which type of Schengen visa is valid for staying in the entire Schengen area. They discuss various conditions and consequences related to Schengen visas, but they do not specify which type of visa allows for staying in the entire Schengen area. Sentence 2 is the only one that provides the answer, but it is not explicitly stated that it refers to a specific type of Schengen visa. Therefore, the answer must be inferred from the context.
