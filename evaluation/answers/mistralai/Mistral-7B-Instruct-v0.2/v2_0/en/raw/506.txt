These apps offer navigation function, timetable information, and digital mobile phone tickets for traveling in Munich. They are free to download in the app store or via Google Play. The MVG app and MVV app both offer all connections with departure and arrival times, estimated walking distances, and information about the current operating situation of the escalators and lifts. The possibility to buy mobile tickets without cash when you’re out and about is particularly useful. Simply register, select the ticket, and pay by credit card or direct debit. The ticket is saved on your mobile phone and can be shown at any time if there is a ticket control, even if there’s no mobile phone reception.
