Answer: No, you do not need to know German to apply for a work permit. However, you may need to learn German to perform the specific job for which you are granted a work permit.

Sentence numbers: 3, 9, 11 (The context does not specify that knowing German is a requirement for applying for a work permit, but it mentions that the future employer must fill in a form about the conditions of the job and the applicant must fill in the "Application for permission to work.")
