Answer: Integration courses and normal language courses are different in their focus and target audience. Integration courses are designed for immigrants and refugees to learn the German language and integrate into German society, while normal language courses are for anyone interested in learning German as a second language, regardless of their background or immigration status.

Sentence numbers: 1, 2 (for the context that mentions the possibility of looking for a suitable course), 5 (for the mention of language counseling at the vhs Augsburger Land, which likely offers integration courses), 11 (for the mention of language advice at the Augsburg Adult Education Center, which may offer normal language courses) and 12 (for the confirmation that consultations take place for those interested in learning German)

However, the context itself does not provide enough information to determine which specific courses are offered at each institution and their exact focus. Therefore, it's recommended to contact the institutions directly for more information.
