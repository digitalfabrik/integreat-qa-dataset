Explanation: The context states that everyone living in Germany must follow the Grundgesetz (basic law) (sentence 2), and it also mentions that all persons are equal before the law and cannot be favored or disfavored based on various factors, including gender, race, and disability (sentences 24, 28, 29). Therefore, the answer includes these sentence numbers. The other sentences in the context do not directly answer the question.
