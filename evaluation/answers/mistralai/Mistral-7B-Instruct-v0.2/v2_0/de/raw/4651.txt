## Answer: Ab dem Alter von 10 Jahren. ## Sentences: 1, 4

Explanation: The context mentions that Gymnasium is for students from 5th to 12th or 13th grade. Since the German school system typically starts at 6 years old, students can start Gymnasium at the age of 10. Additionally, the context mentions that there are special programs for newly arrived children and youths, which further supports the idea that students can start Gymnasium at a younger age.
