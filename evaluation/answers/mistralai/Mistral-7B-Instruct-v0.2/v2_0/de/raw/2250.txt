## Answer: Ja, um in Deutschland zu arbeiten, muss man eine Arbeitserlaubnis haben. ## Sentence numbers: 3, 9

The context states that in order to work in Germany, one must apply for and receive an Arbeitserlaubnis (work permit) from the Ausländerbehörde (foreigners authority). The application process involves the future employer completing a form about the employment conditions and the applicant filling out the "Antrag auf Arbeitserlaubnis" (application for work permit) themselves. Therefore, having the ability to understand and communicate in German would be beneficial, but it is not explicitly stated that it is a requirement for obtaining a work permit. However, the requirement for a work permit implies that there is some level of interaction with German authorities and employers, making German language proficiency a practical necessity.
