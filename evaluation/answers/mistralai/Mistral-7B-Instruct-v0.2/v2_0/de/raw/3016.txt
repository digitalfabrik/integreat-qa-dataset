## Answer: Paid pauses are those pauses that are granted and paid by the employer, while unpaid pauses are those pauses that are not paid by the employer. ## Sentence numbers: -1

## Explanation:
The context does not provide any information about paid or unpaid pauses. Therefore, the answer is "None." and the numbers are "-1". However, based on the general understanding of the term "pausen" in German, which can refer to both paid and unpaid breaks, it is assumed that the question is asking about the difference between paid and unpaid breaks. Thus, the provided answer is an assumption based on the question and not on the context.
