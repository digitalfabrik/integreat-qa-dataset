## Answer: Sie können sich an die Gemeinde Ihres Wohnorts wenden, um sich an Freiwilligendiensten zu beteiligen und ihre Integration in Deutschland zu unterstützen. ## Sentence numbers: 12

Explanation: The context provides information about what volunteering is and in which areas one can get involved. It also mentions that volunteering brings people together and is important for everyone. However, it does not directly answer the question about how to engage in volunteering in Germany to support one's integration. The answer is found in sentence 12, which suggests contacting the local community for volunteering opportunities.
