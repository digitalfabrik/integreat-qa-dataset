## Answer: The individual's stay in Germany or the Schengen Area becomes illegal. ## Sentence numbers: 16, 17, 18, 19

Explanation: The context states that if someone stays beyond the maximum allowed duration without applying for an residence title, their stay becomes illegal (Gesetzesversto√ü). The authorities can then end the stay and a re-entry would only be possible if there is no entry ban. Additionally, there is a possibility of legal proceedings.
