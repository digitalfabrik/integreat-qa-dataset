Answer: Asyl is a legal status granted to individuals who are unable or unwilling to return to their country of origin due to a well-founded fear of persecution based on race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion. It provides protection from deportation and allows individuals to stay in a country temporarily or permanently. On the other hand, Geflüchtetensstatus (refugee status) is a specific type of Asyl, which is granted to individuals who have been recognized as refugees under the 1951 Refugee Convention and its 1967 Protocol.
