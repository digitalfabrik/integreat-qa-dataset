## Answer: If you want to know the minimum contract duration you have to observe with your old provider for Internet and TV, it is 24 months. ## Sentence numbers: 3

## Answer: None. ## Numbers: 0, 1, 2, 5-10, 12-16

The context does not provide any information about the minimum contract duration for a single service like Internet or the requirement to maintain a contract with a specific provider for a certain period. It only mentions the 24-month minimum contract duration for both Internet and TV services together. Additionally, the context does not discuss any contractual obligations related to the Rundfunkbeitrag (GEZ) or the use of a television in an asylum shelter.
