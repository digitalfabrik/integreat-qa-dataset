The context mentions that during various elections in Germany, people can cast both a personal (or first) vote and a list (or second) vote. The personal vote is used to elect a specific candidate, while the list vote is used to elect a party or a group of candidates. Therefore, the answer sentences are those that mention the terms "Personlichkeits-Stimme" (which translates to "personal vote" or "first vote") and "Liste-Stimme" (which translates to "list vote" or "second vote") or their English equivalents.
