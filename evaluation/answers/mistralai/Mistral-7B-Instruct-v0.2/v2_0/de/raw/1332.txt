Sentence numbers: 1, 3-5, 6, 8, 11, 14, 15, 16, 17-19, 21

Explanation: The context clearly states that the German healthcare system consists of three main areas: ambulant medical care, stationary medical care, and population health protection. The ambulant medical care refers to medical care provided by doctors and pharmacies where the patient goes home after treatment (sentences 3-5). The stationary medical care refers to medical care provided in hospitals where the patient stays for treatment (sentence 6). The population health protection refers to the protective health services offered by the health office, such as infection protection and preventive services (sentences 8, 14-19). The context also mentions that everyone can freely choose their doctor or healthcare facility (sentence 11), and the health office provides preventive services like information and counseling (sentences 15-19). Therefore, the answer sentences are those that describe the three main areas of the German healthcare system.
