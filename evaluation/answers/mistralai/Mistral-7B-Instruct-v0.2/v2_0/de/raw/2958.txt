## Answer: I can express my opinion freely as long as I do not violate laws or other people's personal rights. ## Sentence numbers: 1, 2, 4

The context states that all people have the right to build and freely express their own opinions (sentence 1), and they can also publicly state their opinions (sentence 2). However, they must also consider the personal rights of others (sentence 4). This means that while people can express their opinions freely, they cannot use defamatory language or incite hatred or violence (sentences 13-16), which would violate the personal rights of others. Therefore, the answer is that one can express their opinion freely as long as they do not violate laws or other people's personal rights.
