## Answer: Ein Ausbildungsprogramm für Flüchtlinge in Deutschland ist die Ausbildungsvorbereitung dual (AVdual). ## Sentence numbers: 0-2, 6, 8, 9, 51-53

Explanation: While the context does not explicitly mention "Flüchtlinge" (refugees), it does provide information about the AVdual program, which is available to anyone looking for their first vocational training or a career change (sentence 19). This includes refugees. The text also mentions that AVdual provides support in planning a career path and creating job application materials (sentences 4 and 5), which would be relevant to refugees seeking employment or training in Germany. Additionally, the Jugendmigrationsdienst Schorndorf (sentences 27-29) offers support and guidance to young migrants, which would include refugees.
