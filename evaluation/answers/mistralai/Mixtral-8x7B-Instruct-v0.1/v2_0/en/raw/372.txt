## Answer: Recycling containers, recycling centers. ## Sentence numbers: 42, 43, 44

Explanation: The context mentions that recyclable materials such as glass, metal cans, and plastic packaging can be placed in the recycling containers (sentence 42). It also mentions that bulky waste, broken electrical appliances, and hazardous waste can be taken to the recycling centers (sentence 43). Additionally, the context states that used items in good condition can be bought and sold in second-hand stores or at flea markets (sentence 51), which can also be considered a form of recycling. However, the context does not explicitly mention that used items can be recycled at recycling centers, so it is not clear whether this is an option.
