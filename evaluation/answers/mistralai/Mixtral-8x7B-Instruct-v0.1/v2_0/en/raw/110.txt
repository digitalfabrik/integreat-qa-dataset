## Answer: No. ## Sentence numbers: 16, 27, 32, 34, 35
The context states that U-examinations are always free of charge in Bavaria (sentence 16). However, there are some medical check-ups and treatments that are not free of charge, such as certain preventive medical check-ups (sentence 27), part of dental treatment costs (sentence 32), and a daily hospital allowance (sentence 34). People on low incomes can apply for exemptions (sentences 29, 35). But specifically for the U-examinations, there is no charge.
