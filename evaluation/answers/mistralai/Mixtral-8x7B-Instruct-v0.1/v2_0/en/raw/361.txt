## Answer: If you have been living legally and habitually in Germany for at least eight years, you can apply for naturalization. Spouses and children can also be naturalized, even if they have lived in Germany for a shorter period of time. Young people aged 16 and over can apply for naturalization themselves. Different requirements apply to certain groups of persons (e.g. persons entitled to asylum, spouses of Germans) (e.g. shorter minimum residence periods). ## Sentence numbers: 2, 3, 4, 5
