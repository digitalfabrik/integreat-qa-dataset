## Answer: Visitor visa (Schengen visa) ## Sentence numbers: 0, 1, 2, 6, 8, 9, 11, 12

Explanation:
The context states that a Visitor visa (Schengen visa) allows the holder to stay in the entire Schengen area for a period of 180 days to 90 days (sentence 2). The visa must be issued by the embassy and can be extended in Germany if certain conditions are met (sentences 6 and 7). The purpose of the visa cannot be changed (sentence 8), but force majeure, humanitarian, professional, or serious personal reasons can be taken into account (sentence 11). The context also mentions legal consequences for overstaying the visa (sentences 13-16), but this is not directly related to the question.
