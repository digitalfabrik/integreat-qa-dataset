## Answer: You can look for training with a tolerated stay permit at the regional council, where you need to submit your training contract. The training should be in a state-recognized or comparably regulated training occupation with a standard training period of at least two years. Your identity needs to be clarified, but this requirement may be waived in certain circumstances. You will not receive a training permit with an introductory qualification (EQ), but such a qualification can still offer advantages. ## Sentence numbers: 6, 9, 10, 13, 14, 15, 17, 18
