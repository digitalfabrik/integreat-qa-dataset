Ukraine and residency in Germany\nInformation from the Bundesministeriums f\u00fcr Arbeit und Soziales (Federal Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs, BMAS):\nThe Federal Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs helps people who have fled to Germany because of war with issues relating to employment and social security.\nInformation from the Federal Foreign Office and the Federal Office for Migration and Refugees\nHere you will find the latest information and situation reports from the Federal ForeignOffice and the Federal Office for Migration and Refugees.\nEntry rules and visa requirements can also be found on the pages.\nWe have included some important questions and answers here:\nI am in Germany without a visa.\nWhat options do I have now?\nThey do not need a visa or residence permit to stay in Germany legally for up to 90 days from the date they enter.\nDuring the 90 days in which you can stay in Germany legally without a visa, you can decide whether you would like to stay in Germany longer.\nIf you decide to stay longer, you have the following options:\nWithin 90 days of entering Germany for the first time, you can apply for a temporary residence permit under section 24 of the Residence Act (Aufenthaltsgesetz, AufenthG).\nSection 24 deals specifically with the situation of refugees from the war in Ukraine based on the relevant EU decision.\nYou can find out here who is eligible for a temporary residence permit under section 24 of the Residence Act, and you can find out more about the procedure here.\nWithin 90 days of entering Germany for the first time, you can apply for a temporary residence permit for a different purpose, such as to study or work in Germany.\nThis may be more advantageous for you.\nYou can make an appointment with the relevant government authorities to ask them for advice.\nOr you can find out more by visiting the website www.make-it-in-germany.com.\nOr you can apply for asylum.\nHowever, we do not recommend this option, because it comes with some disadvantages: your right to take up employment would be subject to restrictions, and you would have to live in an initial reception centre.\nWhat happens after I enter the country?\nWhere can I register in Germany and where do I get accommodation and food?\nThe procedure is divided into four successive steps: First registration and (in the case of benefit recipients) distribution to a place of residence, as well as registration of the residential address at the destination and application for a residence title.\nYou can find further information here.\nCan I work in Germany with a residence permit for temporary protection?\nYes, you can.\nHowever, gainful employment must first be permitted by the foreigners authority.\nWhen the residence permit is issued, the foreigners authority will already enter in the residence title that gainful employment is permitted, even if no concrete job is in prospect yet.\nThis means that no further work permit from another authority is required.\nThe foreigners authorities will issue so-called probationary certificates when an application is submitted.\nThese bypass the residence law until the actual residence title can be issued and granted.\nThe foreigners authority will also enter \"gainful employment permitted\" in the probationary certificate.\nEven with this probationary certificate, it is therefore possible to work in Germany on a self-employed basis or as an employee.\nSpecial professional access requirements (such as a licence to practise medicine or a permit for a trade requiring a licence) naturally apply to temporarily protected persons just like to everyone else.\nBut the procedures for the recognition of foreign professional qualifications are also open to those affected, just like everyone else.\nPersons with a residence permit for temporary protection in Germany are also eligible for advice and placement services in accordance with Social Code III (SGB III) through the employment agencies.\nShould Ukrainian nationals have to apply for asylum?\nNo, that is not necessary.\nThe required protection will be granted in another, faster procedure.\nUkrainian nationals are therefore advised not to apply for asylum.\nHowever, the right to apply for asylum at a later stage continues regardless.\nAs a result of the Decision to admit war refugees pursuant to Article 5 para.\nGranting of residence for temporary protection) will be granted with immediate effect to the group of persons covered upon application.\nRegistration upon entry does not constitute an asylum application.\nThe implementation of an asylum procedure requires an application for asylum to be filed at the competent branch office of the Federal Office for Migration and Refugees.\nFor these reasons, filing an asylum application is not required to secure a right of residence or to claim social benefits.\nInformation portal of the German government\nThe Federal Ministry of the Interior and Home Affairs offers a digital information service in German, English, Russian, and Ukrainian.\nHere you can find all official information about residence and life in Germany.\nGermany4Ukraine\nEmbassy of Ukraine
