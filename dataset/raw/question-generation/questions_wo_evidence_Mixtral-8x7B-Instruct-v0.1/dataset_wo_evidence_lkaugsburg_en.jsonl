and situation reports from the Federal ForeignOffice and the Federal Office for Migration and Refugees.\nEntry rules and visa requirements can also be found on the pages.\nWe have included some important questions and answers here:\nI am in Germany without a visa.\nWhat options do I have now?\nThey do not need a visa or residence permit to stay in Germany legally for up to 90 days from the date they enter.\nDuring the 90 days in which you can stay in Germany legally without a visa, you can decide whether you would like to stay in Germany longer.\nIf you decide to stay longer, you have the following options:\nWithin 90 days of entering Germany for the first time, you can apply for a temporary residence permit under section 24 of the Residence Act (Aufenthaltsgesetz, AufenthG).\nSection 24 deals specifically with the situation of refugees from the war in Ukraine based on the relevant EU decision.\nYou can find out here who is eligible for a temporary residence permit under section 24 of the Residence Act, and you can find out more about the procedure here.\nWithin 90 days of entering Germany for the first time, you can apply for a temporary residence permit for a different purpose, such as to study or work in Germany.\nThis may be more advantageous for you.\nYou can make an appointment with the relevant government authorities to ask them for advice.\nOr you can find out more by visiting the website www.make-it-in-germany.com.\nOr you can apply for asylum.\nHowever, we do not recommend this option, because it comes with some disadvantages: your right to take up employment would be subject to restrictions, and you would have to live in an initial reception centre.\nWhat happens after I enter the country?\nWhere can I register in Germany and where do I get accommodation and food?\nThe procedure is divided into four successive steps: First registration and (in the case of benefit recipients) distribution to a place of residence, as well as registration of the residential address at the destination and application for a residence title.\nYou can find further information here.\nCan I work in Germany with a residence permit for temporary protection?\nYes, you can.\nHowever, gainful employment must first be permitted by the foreigners authority.\nWhen the residence permit is issued, the foreigners authority will already enter in the residence title that gainful employment is permitted, even if no concrete job is in prospect yet.\nThis means that no further work permit from another authority is required.\nThe foreigners authorities will issue so-called probationary certificates when an application is submitted.\nThese bypass the residence law until the actual residence title can be issued and granted.\nThe foreigners authority will also enter \"gainful employment permitted\" in the probationary certificate.\nEven with this probationary certificate, it is therefore possible to work in Germany on a self-employed basis or as an employee.\nSpecial professional access requirements (such as a licence to practise medicine or a permit for a trade requiring a licence) naturally apply to temporarily protected persons just like to everyone else.\nBut the procedures for the recognition of foreign professional qualifications are also open to those affected, just like everyone else.\nPersons with a residence permit for temporary protection in Germany are also eligible for advice and placement services in accordance with Social Code III (SGB III) through the employment agencies.\nShould Ukrainian nationals have to apply for asylum?\nNo, that is not necessary.\nThe required protection will be granted in another, faster procedure.\nUkrainian nationals are therefore advised not to apply for asylum.\nHowever, the right to apply for asylum at a later stage continues regardless.\nAs a result of the Decision to admit war refugees pursuant to Article 5 para.\nGranting of residence for temporary protection) will be granted with immediate effect to the group of persons covered upon application.\nRegistration upon entry does not constitute an asylum application.\nThe implementation of an asylum procedure requires an application for asylum to be filed at the competent branch office of the Federal Office for Migration and Refugees.\nFor these reasons, filing an asylum application is not required to secure a right of residence or to claim social benefits.\nInformation portal of the German government\nThe Federal Ministry of the Interior and Home Affairs offers a digital information service in

mind.\nRemember:\nOnline shopping does not only have positive effects.\nPackaging material and returns are a burden on the environment.\nAnd local shops can't keep up with the competition on the internet either.\nThat's why many shops are closing.\nLocal shops are empty.\nIt is therefore worth considering what you order online or buy locally.\nWhat should I look out for when shopping online?\nReputable online shop or fake shop?\nDo you want to order something online?\nThen you should find out about the online shop beforehand.\nBecause not all platforms are reputable.\nSo-called fake shops offer cheap goods that you don't receive after payment or that you receive in poor condition.\nHow can I recognise a dubious online retailer?\nConspicuously low price\nThe goods in the online shop are remarkably cheap?\nThis is not always a sign of a fake shop.\nBut you should take a closer look.\nConspicuous Internet address\nA well-known website suddenly shows inconsistencies?\nThe domain extension has been extended (e.g. instead of \".de\" it reads: \".de.com\")?\nThe Internet address contains the keyword \"plants\", but shoes are being sold?\nThen these are signs of a fake shop.\nNo legal notice:\nEvery online shop in the EU must have an imprint.\nIf the legal notice is missing, it is a sign of a dubious online shop.\nHowever, scammers know this too.\nTherefore, make sure that the legal notice includes the following: Address, representative, e-mail address, reference to the commercial register.\nIf these criteria are met, there is a high probability that it is a reputable shop.\nMissing terms and conditions (general terms and conditions) and cancellation conditions\nGTCs are pre-formulated contractual terms and conditions.\nThey are therefore rules that apply to every purchase from this online shop.\nIf you don't find any terms and conditions on the site, you should be careful with this online shop.\nA reputable online shop will provide information about the cancellation conditions.\nYou have a right of cancellation for every purchase.\nUnsafe payment methods\nNormally the rule is: first the goods, then the payment.\nHowever, many shops also offer prepayment.\nPrepayment means that you transfer the money before the goods are dispatched.\nMany payment methods are offered?\nBut in the last step you can only select \"prepayment\" as the payment method?\nThen be careful!\nFalse quality seals\nMany fake shops use quality seals to gain the trust of potential customers.\nDo you see a quality seal on an online shop?\nThen click on it.\nIf the quality seal is not linked to the corresponding website, then it is probably a fake.\nMissing or only positive customer reviews\nCustomer reviews on the online shop's website are not always meaningful.\nOften only positive reviews are published.\nBad reviews are deleted.\nHowever, you can also search for customer reviews on other platforms.\nNo encrypted connection\nMake sure that the online shop has an encrypted connection.\nEspecially if you have to enter your data or bank details.\nInsufficient product descriptions\nDoes the product description match the goods or services on offer?\nIf not, it could be a fake shop.\nDefects in the offer\nBefore making a purchase, you should be informed about delivery times and shipping costs.\nBe careful if this is not the case.\nLack of contact options\nAvoid online shops that only offer an email address or a paid telephone number as a contact option.\nYou can easily check whether an online shop is reputable with the Fake Shop Finder from the consumer advice centre: Fake Shop Finder.\nTips for safe online shopping\nBe careful when entering your details.\nOf course, the online shop needs your name and address for delivery.\nBut sometimes other information is also requested.\nThink about whether you really want to provide them.\nChoose online shops carefully.\nPay attention to the criteria listed above.\nCompare the prices with offers in the shop.\nNot everything is cheaper on the internet.\nPay attention to the total price: Is the price shown really the final purchase price (including taxes, customs duties and shipping costs)?\nContact customer service if you are unsure about something.\nRead the experiences and reviews of other customers.\nCheck again before you place the order: Which products are in your shopping basket?\nWhat are the delivery costs?\nAre there any additional taxes if the product comes from outside the EU?\nPrint out your order or purchase contract, the product description and the terms and conditions and cancellation policy or save them on your computer.\nThis way, the online retailer cannot change anything afterwards.\nYou can find more information on safe online shopping in German and Englishhere (including an explanatory video in German)."}
