Your monthly contribution to pension insurance also entitles you to a state pension in old age.\nSocial security contributions are made up of contributions for:\nPension insurance\nUnemployment insurance\nHealth insurance\nLong-term care insurance\nThe amount depends on the individual income.\nThe contributions are automatically deducted from your gross salary.\nExceptions for foreign employees apply, for example, if they have been posted to Germany by a foreign company, are employed or self-employed in several countries or are affected by other exemptions.\nOne of the requirements for a permanent residence permit is that you have paid pension insurance contributions for at least 60 months.\nThis also applies to self-employed persons.\nThere are also exceptions to this rule.\nSocial security number\nGerman Pension Insurance will automatically send you your social security number by post when you take up your first job in Germany.\nIf you lose your number, you can ask to be notified again:\nTelephone of the German Pension Insurance:\nGerman Pension Insurance","city":"muenchen","language":"en","jaccard":0.5,"sourceLanguage":"de","pageId":5580018},{"id":335,"question":"For which age group does \"Die Arche\" offer advice?","answers":[4],"context":"Crisis counseling and suicide prevention\nCrisis counseling and suicide prevention\n\"Die Arche\" offers counseling for people in life crises, with suicidal thoughts or after a suicide attempt, as well as for people who have lost a loved one to suicide.\nLearn more\nWho for: Adults and young people aged 14 and over\nInterpreters can be organized a few days in advance.\nChildren can be brought along.\nThere is barrier-free access to the building and the rooms.\nThere is a disabled toilet.\nThe offer is free of charge.\nDie Arche e.

in mind.\nRemember that:\nOnline shopping does not only have positive effects.\nPackaging material and returns are a burden on the environment.\nAnd even local stores cannot keep up with the competition on the Internet.\nThat's why many stores are closing.\nThe local stores are empty.\nIt is therefore worth considering what you order on the Internet or buy directly on site.\nWhat should I look out for when shopping online?\nReputable online store or fake store?\nWant to order something online?\nThen you should find out about the online store beforehand.\nBecause not all platforms are reputable.\nSo-called fake stores offer cheap goods that you do not receive after payment or that you receive in poor condition.\nHow can I recognize a dubious online retailer?\nStrikingly low price\nThe goods in the online store are remarkably cheap?\nHowever, this is not always an indication of a fake store.\nBut you should take a closer look.\nConspicuous Internet address\nA well-known website suddenly shows inconsistencies?\nThe domain extension has been extended (e.g.\nB. instead of \".de\" it says: \".de.com\")?\nThe Internet address contains the keyword \"plants\", but it sells shoes?\nThen these are signs of a fake store.\nNo imprint:\nEvery online store in the EU must have an imprint.\nIf the legal notice is missing, it is a sign of a dubious online store.\nHowever, the fraudsters know this too.\nTherefore, make sure that the imprint includes the following: Address, representative, e-mail address, reference to the commercial register.\nIf these criteria are met, it is highly likely that you are dealing with a reputable store.\nMissing GTC (General Terms and Conditions) and termination conditions\nGTCs are pre-formulated contractual terms and conditions.\nSo these are rules that apply to every purchase from this online store.\nIf you cannot find any terms and conditions on the site, then you should be careful with this online store.\nA reputable online store will provide information about the terms of termination.\nYou have a right of withdrawal with every purchase.\nInsecure payment methods\nNormally the rule is: first the goods, then the payment.\nHowever, many stores also offer prepayment.\nPrepayment means: You transfer the money before the goods are dispatched.\nMany payment methods are offered?\nBut in the last step you can only select \"Prepayment\" as the payment method?\nThen be careful!\nFalse quality seals\nMany fake stores use quality seals to gain the trust of potential customers.\nDo you see a quality seal on an online store?\nThen click on it.\nIf the quality seal is not linked to the corresponding website, then it is probably a fake.\nMissing or only positive customer reviews\nCustomer reviews on the online store's website are not always meaningful.\nOften only positive reviews are published.\nThe bad ratings will be deleted.\nYou can also search for customer reviews on other platforms.\nNo encrypted connection\nMake sure that the online store has an encrypted connection.\nEspecially if you have to enter your data or bank details.\nInsufficient product descriptions\nDoes the product description match the goods or services offered?\nIf not, it could be a fake store.\nShortcomings in the offer\nYou should be informed about delivery times and shipping costs before making a purchase.\nBe careful if this is not the case.\nLack of contact options\nAvoid online stores that only offer an e-mail address or a chargeable telephone number as a contact option.\nYou can easily check whether an online store is reputable with the Fake Shop Finder from the consumer advice center: Fake Shop Finder.\nTips for safe online shopping\nBe careful when entering your data.\nOf course, the online store needs your name and address for delivery.\nBut sometimes other things are also asked.\nThink about whether you really want to specify them.\nChoose online stores wisely.\nPay attention to the criteria listed above.\nCompare the prices with offers in the store.\nNot everything is cheaper on the Internet.\nPay attention to the total price: Is the price shown really the final purchase price (including taxes, customs duties and shipping costs)?\nContact customer service if you are unsure about anything.\nRead the experiences and reviews of other customers.\nCheck again before you place the order: Which products are in your shopping cart?\nHow high are the delivery costs?\nAre additional taxes due if the product comes from outside the EU?\nPrint out your order or purchase contract, the product description and the terms and conditions and cancellation policy or save them on your computer.\nThis means that the online retailer cannot change anything afterwards.\nHere you will find further information on safe shopping on the Internet in German and English (including an explanatory video in German).","city":"lkaugsburg","language":"en","jaccard":0.7631578947,"sourceLanguage":"de","pageId":5409708},{"id":1098,"question":"What places are open to families and children to spend their free

women are generally not allowed to work during this time.\nYour workplace remains intact.\nYou can return to work at the end of your maternity leave.\nIn addition, pregnant women may not work more than 8.5 hours per day.\nThey are also not allowed to do any heavy physical work.\nYou can find out more about this from your employer, from one of the advice centers listed below or here.\nFinancial support\nIf you have little or no income, you can apply for unemployment benefit II or social assistance.\nAfter the twelfth week of pregnancy, the Jobcenter or social welfare office will pay expectant mothers an additional requirement.\nAnd also the initial equipment for pregnancy and baby.\nDelivery and aftercare\nYour gynecologist will refer you to a maternity clinic.\nAsk there for a midwife for aftercare.\nIf the clinic does not provide a midwife, contact \"Fr\u00fche Hilfen\/ KoKi\".\nYou will receive a birth certificate from the clinic.\nYou need a birth certificate from the registry office to apply for a birth certificate for your child.\nYou also need the birth certificate if you are applying for parental allowance.\nNotification to the registry office\nNewborn children must be registered with the registry office.\nThe maternity clinic is responsible for registering the birth with the registry office.\nFor the birth certificate you need:\nYour ID card\nthe birth

18 languages.\nHelpline for pregnant women in need\nTermination of pregnancy (abortion)\nSometimes women want to terminate the pregnancy.\nThis can continue until the end of the 12th week.\nThe

certificate\nThree-day waiting period between counseling and abortion\nThe abortion is performed by a doctor.\nHere you will find brief information on abortion in several languages.\nState-recognized

company and year of the apprenticeship).\nThere are roughly 330 professions for which a candidate can undertake a dual apprenticeship.\nJust how a dual apprenticeship works is explained in information

C?","answers":[21,22],"context":"Further vaccination recommendations of the STIKO\n1. TBE (early summer meningoencephalitis)\nTBE is transmitted via tick bites.\nPossible consequences of a disease are inflammations of the brain, the meninges and the spinal cord.\nEspecially Bavaria, Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg and southern parts of Hesse, Thuringia and Saxony are considered risk areas in Germany.\nEspecially in these areas, vaccination against TBE is recommended by the STIKO.\nAll children can attend from the age of 1. The vaccination against TBE must be carried out before the child's 60th birthday.\n2. Influenza (flu)\nInfluenza is contagious in a similar way to a normal cold (flu).\nTransmission in kindergartens and schools usually occurs from child to child or via objects.\nChildren with pre-existing conditions are particularly affected.\nComplications such as pneumonia can occur in them.\nThe recommendation for annual flu vaccination is therefore only aimed at children with a higher risk of complications.\nYou can find more information about the affected pre-existing conditionshere.\n3. HPV (human papilloma viruses)\nPapilloma viruses can cause cancer in the long term.\nVaccination can therefore reduce the risk of cancers of the cervix, anus, penis and throat.\nVaccination before the first sexual contact offers the best protection.\nBoth vaccinations are recommended between the ages of 9 and 14.\n4. Meningococcus\nMeningococci are bacteria that can cause bacterial meningitis or blood poisoning (sepsis).\nChildren under the age of 5 and adolescents are particularly at risk.\nVaccination against meningococcal type C is recommended at the age of 12 months.\nThere is currently no general recommendation for vaccination against other types (B and ACWY).\nThe bacteria are transmitted via so-called droplet infection, i.e. for example via coughing, sneezing or kissing.\n5. Pneumococcus\nPneumococcus is the most common pathogen of severe bacterial infections.\nThey can cause meningitis, pneumonia or middle ear infections and are especially dangerous for babies and small children.\nThree vaccinations are recommended against pneumococci, which should be administered at the same time as the vaccination against tetanus, diphtheria, whooping cough.\n6. Rotaviruses\nRotaviruses are the most common cause of diarrhoea and vomiting in children.\nThe pathogen is very contagious, which is why almost all children contract it in the first five years - usually at the age of 2. Especially in infants, a large loss of fluids and salt can lead to dangerous dehydration, which may have to be treated in hospital.\nRotaviruses are vaccinated two or three times, depending on the vaccine.\nThe first vaccination should be given between 6 weeks and 2 months of age, the second at 3 months and the third, if necessary, at 4 months.\nVaccination against the Corona virus is currently recommended for children aged 5 to 11 years only with the vaccine \"Comirnaty\" from BioNTech\/Pfizer.\nVaccinations can be given at intervals of three to six weeks between the first and second vaccination.\nThe vaccination recommendation is primarily aimed at children who have an increased risk of a severe course due to a previous illness.\nIn addition, the recommendation also applies to children in whose environment there are persons with a high risk of a severe COVID-19 course, if they themselves cannot be vaccinated or the vaccination protection is not sufficient.\nThere is currently no recommendation for children without their own pre-existing conditions or pre-existing conditions of close contacts.\nNevertheless, it is possible to have your child vaccinated after consulting a doctor.\nFor more information on the affected pre-existing conditions, see:\nhttps:\/\/www.zusammengegencorona.de\/impfen\/kinder\/corona-schutzimpfung-ab-5-jahren\/\nFurther information
