The vaccination against TBE must be carried out before the child's 60th birthday.\n2. Influenza (flu)\nInfluenza is contagious in a similar way to a normal cold (flu).\nTransmission in kindergartens and schools usually occurs from child to child or via objects.\nChildren with pre-existing conditions are particularly affected.\nComplications such as pneumonia can occur in them.\nThe recommendation for annual flu vaccination is therefore only aimed at children with a higher risk of complications.\nYou can find more information about the affected pre-existing conditionshere.\n3. HPV (human papilloma viruses)\nPapilloma viruses can cause cancer in the long term.\nVaccination can therefore reduce the risk of cancers of the cervix, anus, penis and throat.\nVaccination before the first sexual contact offers the best protection.\nBoth vaccinations are recommended between the ages of 9 and 14.\n4. Meningococcus\nMeningococci are bacteria that can cause bacterial meningitis or blood poisoning (sepsis).\nChildren under the age of 5 and adolescents are particularly at risk.\nVaccination against meningococcal type C is recommended at the age of 12 months.\nThere is currently no general recommendation for vaccination against other types (B and ACWY).\nThe bacteria are transmitted via so-called droplet infection, i.e. for example via coughing, sneezing or kissing.\n5.

Rotaviruses\nRotaviruses are the most common cause of diarrhoea and vomiting in children.\nThe pathogen is very contagious, which is why almost all children contract it in the first five years - usually at the age of 2. Especially in infants, a large loss of fluids and salt can lead to dangerous dehydration, which may have to be treated in hospital.\nRotaviruses are vaccinated two or three times, depending on the vaccine.\nThe first vaccination should be given between 6 weeks and 2 months of age, the second at 3 months and the third, if necessary, at 4 months.\nVaccination against the Corona virus is currently recommended for children aged 5 to 11 years only with the vaccine \"Comirnaty\" from BioNTech/Pfizer.\nVaccinations can be given at intervals of three to six weeks between the first and second vaccination.\nThe vaccination recommendation is primarily aimed at children who have an increased risk of a severe course due to a previous illness.\nIn addition, the recommendation also applies to children in whose environment there are persons with a high risk of a severe COVID-19 course, if they themselves cannot be vaccinated or the vaccination protection is not sufficient.\nThere is currently no recommendation for children without their own pre-existing conditions or pre-existing conditions of close contacts.\nNevertheless, it is possible to have your child vaccinated after consulting a doctor.\nFor more information on the affected pre-existing conditions, see:\nhttps://www.zusammengegencorona.de/impfen/kinder/corona-schutzimpfung-ab-5-jahren/\nFurther information on the above vaccination recommendations here.", "city": "lkaugsburg", "language": "en", "jaccard": 1.0, "sourceLanguage": null, "pageId": 977189}

such as the restriction on taking up employment and the obligation to live in an initial reception facility.\nWhat happens after entry?\nWhere can I register in Germany and where can I get accommodation and meals?\nThe procedure is divided into four consecutive steps: initial registration and (if receiving social benefits) allocation to a place of residence, as well as registration of the residential address at the destination and application for a residence permit.\nFurther information can be found here.\nCan I work in Germany with a residence permit for temporary protection?\nYes, that is possible.\nHowever, gainful employment must first be permitted by the foreigners authority.\nThe immigration authority will already enter in the residence permit that gainful employment is permitted when issuing the residence permit, even if there is no concrete employment relationship in prospect.\nThis means that no further work permit from another authority is required.\nThe immigration authorities will issue so-called fictitious certificates as soon as an application is submitted.\nThese bridge the right of residence until the actual residence permit can be issued and granted.\nThe foreigners authority will also enter \"Gainful employment permitted\" in the fictitious certificate.\nThis fictitious certificate already allows you to work in Germany as a self-employed person or as an employee.\nSpecial professional access requirements (such as a license to practice medicine or a permit for a trade requiring a license) naturally apply to persons with temporary protection in the same way as to all others.\nHowever, the procedures for the recognition of foreign professional qualifications are also open to those affected, just like everyone else.\nPeople with a residence permit for temporary protection in Germany can also receive advice and placement services from the employment agencies in accordance with SGB III.\nShould Ukrainian nationals apply for asylum?\nNo, that is not necessary.\nThe necessary protection is granted in a different, faster procedure.\nUkrainian nationals are therefore advised to refrain from applying for asylum.\nHowever, the right to submit an application for asylum at a later date continues to exist regardless of this.\nRegistration upon entry does not constitute an application for asylum.\nThe asylum procedure requires an application for asylum to be submitted to the responsible branch office of the Federal Office for Migration and Refugees.\nFor these reasons, it is not necessary to apply for asylum in order to secure a right of residence or to claim social benefits.\nInformation portal of the German government\nThe Federal Ministry of the Interior and for Home Affairs offers a digital information service in German, English, Russian and Ukrainian.\nHere you will find all the official information about residence and living in Germany.\nGermany4Ukraine\nEmbassy of Ukraine in Berlin", "city": "muenchen", "language": "en", "jaccard": 0.75, "sourceLanguage": "de", "pageId": 5582623}

"context": "Online shopping\nMore and more people are shopping online.\nThere are a few things to bear in mind.\nRemember that:\nOnline shopping does not only have positive effects.\nPackaging material and returns are a burden on the environment.\nAnd even local stores cannot keep up with the competition on the Internet.\nThat's why many stores are closing.\nThe local stores are empty.\nIt is therefore worth considering what you order on the Internet or buy directly on site.\nWhat should I look out for when shopping online?\nReputable online store or fake store?\nWant to order something online?\nThen you should find out about the online store beforehand.\nBecause not all platforms are reputable.\nSo-called fake stores offer cheap goods that you do not receive after payment or that you receive in poor condition.\nHow can I recognize a dubious online retailer?\nStrikingly low price\nThe goods in the online store are remarkably cheap?\nHowever, this is not always an indication of a fake store.\nBut you should take a closer look.\nConspicuous Internet address\nA well-known website suddenly shows inconsistencies?\nThe domain extension has been extended (e.g.\nB. instead of \".de\" it says: \".de.com\")?\nThe Internet address contains the keyword \"plants\", but it sells shoes?\nThen these are signs of a fake store.\nNo imprint:\nEvery online store in the EU must have an imprint.\nIf the legal notice is missing, it is a sign of a dubious online store.\nHowever, the fraudsters know this too.\nTherefore, make sure that the imprint includes the following: Address, representative, e-mail address, reference to the commercial register.\nIf these criteria are met, it is highly likely that you are dealing with a reputable store.\nMissing GTC (General Terms and Conditions) and termination conditions\nGTCs are pre-formulated contractual terms and conditions.\nSo these are rules that apply to every purchase from this online store.\nIf you cannot find any terms and conditions on the site, then you should be careful with this online store.\nA reputable online store will provide information about the terms of termination.\nYou have a right of withdrawal with every purchase.\nInsecure payment methods\nNormally the rule is: first the goods, then the payment.\nHowever, many stores also offer prepayment.\nPrepayment means: You transfer the money before the goods are dispatched.\nMany payment methods are offered?\nBut in the last step you can only select \"Prepayment\" as the payment method?\nThen be careful!\nFalse quality seals\nMany fake stores use quality seals to gain the trust of potential customers.\nDo you see a quality seal on an online store?\nThen click on it.\nIf the quality seal is not linked to the corresponding website, then it is probably a fake.\nMissing or only positive customer reviews\nCustomer reviews on the online store's website are not always meaningful.\nOften only positive reviews are published.\nThe bad ratings will be deleted.\nYou can also search for customer reviews on other platforms.\nNo encrypted connection\nMake sure that the online store has an encrypted connection.\nEspecially if you have to enter your data or bank details.\nInsufficient product descriptions\nDoes the product description match the goods or services offered?\nIf not, it could be a fake store.\nShortcomings in the offer\nYou should be informed about delivery times and shipping costs before making a purchase.\nBe careful if this is not the case.\nLack of contact options\nAvoid online stores that only offer an e-mail address or a chargeable telephone number as a contact option.\nYou can easily check whether an online store is reputable with the Fake Shop Finder from the consumer advice center: Fake Shop Finder.\nTips for safe online shopping\nBe careful when entering your data.\nOf course, the online store needs your name and address for delivery.\nBut sometimes other things are also asked.\nThink about whether you really want to specify them.\nChoose online stores wisely.\nPay attention to the criteria listed above.\nCompare the prices with offers in the store.\nNot everything is cheaper on the Internet.\nPay attention to the total price: Is the price shown really the final purchase price (including taxes, customs duties and shipping costs)?\nContact customer service if you are unsure about anything.\nRead the experiences and reviews of other customers.\nCheck again before you place the order: Which products are in your shopping cart?\nHow high are the delivery costs?\nAre additional taxes due if the product comes from outside the EU?\nPrint out your order or purchase contract, the product description and the terms and conditions and cancellation policy or save them on your computer.\nThis means

HPV (human papillomavirus)\nPapillomaviruses can cause cancer in the long term.\nVaccination can therefore reduce the risk of cancer of the cervix, anus, penis and throat.\nVaccination before the first sexual contact offers the best protection.\nBoth vaccinations are recommended between the ages of 9 and 14.\n4. meningococci\nMeningococci are bacteria that can cause bacterial meningitis or blood poisoning (sepsis).\nChildren under the age of 5 and adolescents in particular are among the risk groups.\nVaccination against meningococcal type C is recommended at the age of 12 months.\nThere is currently no general recommendation for vaccinations against other types (B and ACWY).\nThe bacteria are transmitted via the so-called\nDroplet infection.\nThis means, for example, coughing, sneezing or kissing.\n5. pneumococci\nPneumococcus is the most common pathogen causing serious bacterial infections.\nThey can cause meningitis, pneumonia or middle ear infections.\nThey are particularly dangerous for babies and small children.\nThree vaccinations against pneumococci are recommended.\nThese should be administered at the same time as the vaccination against tetanus, diphtheria and whooping cough.\n6. rotaviruses\nRotaviruses are the most common cause of diarrhea and vomiting in children.\nThe pathogen is very contagious.\nThis is why almost all children contract the disease in the first five years - usually at the age of 2.\nIn infants in particular, a large loss of fluids and salt can lead to dangerous dehydration.\nThis may have to be\nbe treated in hospital.\nVaccination against rotaviruses is given two or three times, depending on the vaccine.\nThe first vaccination should be given between 6 weeks and 2 months of age.\nThe second vaccination at 3 months.\nAnd the third, if necessary, at 4 months.\nVaccination against the coronavirus is currently only recommended for children aged 5 to 11 years with the \"Comirnaty\" vaccine from BioNTech/Pfizer.\nVaccinations can be given three to six weeks apart between the first and second vaccination.\nThe vaccination recommendation is primarily aimed at children who have an increased risk of a severe course due to a previous illness.\nIn addition, the recommendation also applies to children who are surrounded by people with a high risk of severe COVID-19 if they cannot be vaccinated themselves or the vaccination protection is not sufficient.\nThere is currently no recommendation for children without pre-existing illnesses or pre-existing illnesses of close contacts.\nNevertheless, it is possible to have your child vaccinated after consulting a doctor.\nFurther information on the pre-existing conditions concerned can be found at:\nhttps://www.zusammengegencorona.de/impfen/kinder/corona-schutzimpfung-ab-5-jahren/\nFurther information on the vaccination recommendations mentioned here.", "city": "lkaugsburg", "language": "en", "jaccard": 1.0, "sourceLanguage": "de", "pageId": 5347094}
